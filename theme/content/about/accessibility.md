title: "Our Accessibility Process"
subtitle: "Accessibility is key to what we do - events are always as physically accessible as possible - and event access info is always presented in event descriptions."

We know how challenging it can sometimes be to find detailed accessibility information about venues. 

As part of the process of being part of the Fruit Salad Events Collective - event organisers are required to provide detailed accessibility information, so that you are able to make an informed choice about whether an event will be possible and comfortable for you to attend.

For more details on a particular event we recommend having a look at the organisers social media pages - there are usually photos and videos of spaces used and past events.

This website was designed by Geeks for Social Change to be as usable as possible, aiming to conform to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref) to level AA.
