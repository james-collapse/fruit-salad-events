title: "About"
subtitle: "Fruit Salad Events is a collective of LGBTQIA+ event organisers who bring you all sorts of events that are designed with conversation and connection in mind, and a focus on accessibility."
---

We are a collective of independent LGBTQIA+ event organisers based in London, we create events where queer folk can connect in person and through FSEC we support each other in providing these spaces for people to meet.

The events we provide are always for the LGBTQIA+ community - and always trans-inclusive - including where a more specific demographic is stated e.g. sapphic.

The Fruit Salad events collective is run by an action group of FSEC members - who are event organisers or community members happy to lend a hand. 

If you put on events that fit our vision please get in touch to join the collective, either as an active member, or just to benefit from cross promotion and a community of other organisers!
